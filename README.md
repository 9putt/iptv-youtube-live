# IPTV based on YouTube Live Channels
M3U playlists of YouTube live channels. Add them to any IPTV client. Steps on how to add them are available at my [notes](https://abskmj.github.io/notes/posts/projects/youtube-live-channels/).

## Channels
Open an [issue](https://github.com/abskmj/iptv-youtube-live/issues/new) on this repository with the YouTube link to add a new channel/video or report a broken one.
